#It's Back On!

Coming back from a bit of a hiatus. Andy and I (Dano) have fallen off track a little in our weight loss goals. This type of thing happens to all of us and we have decided to relive the competition to get back in shape. I personally love the opportunity to win this time. 

#New Rules and Goals

We learned a lot from our previous competition and have changed the rules accordingly. 

1. *Smaller iterations* - 30 day mini-competitions. Before we went the full 6 months towards one common victory. This totally kills motivation. We think a larger competition made up of smaller competitions will help keep us on track. It will also allow us to try something out and validate our ideas. 
2. *We've Changed* - In the last couple of years we have had changes in our personal lives, from us both having new jobs, mine being full-time and for myself I became a vegetarian, 2 years+ now. 
3. *Weekly Podcasts?* - I'm personally up in the air on this one. This time around I'd like to see how dynamically we can be with our content. Though, I believe the weekly podcast kept us in check last time around, I'd like to have something else hold us accountable. Maybe a weekly checkin online?
