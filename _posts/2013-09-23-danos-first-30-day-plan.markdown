#Diet

For the first part of the challenge, I'm going to try to lose the lbs on what might seem like the strictest diet possible, but just might be the most free diet I've tried.

Like the saying, *insanity is trying the same thing over and expecting different results*, well this is how I feel about calorie restriction. It works, but only temporally and only when you spend a ton of your bandwidth counting calories inside a tiny computer. This isn't living. I'd rather just enjoy eating and not think about it. With calorie restriction, not only do I get to feel guilty about what I've eaten but I just can't be in the moment and that sucks. I'd love to try this diet and hopefully the benefits I've heard work for me as well.

So my goal for the first 30 days is to try to follow what is called the 80-10-10 diet. 

In theory, on a 80-10-10 diet, I can eat, eat, and eat. 

###The breakdown:

- 80% - Fruit.
- 10% - Salad.
- 10% - Nuts and Grains. 

That's right, not only is this vegan, but it's mostly RAW!

My only tweak is that I will be drinking a plant based protein shake after each workout. 

#Workout

Nothing to crazy here beyond more focus. My work out plans are to do a session of cardio followed by weight training. The sessions will occur in the morning 5:00am and I will take Monday's off. 

###I'm thinking my workouts will look like:

1. Tuesday - Cardio, Arms, Fore-Arms, Abs 
2. Wednesday - Cardio, Shoulder, Back, Abs
3. Thursday - Cardio, Legs, Abs
4. Friday -  Cardio, Experiment with full body workouts
5. Saturday - Cardio, Arms, Fire-Arms, Abs
6. Sunday - Cardio, Shoulder, Back, Abs
7. Monday - Off (Relax) 

I'd also like to have some good muscle gain too, but that's only because I feel like I have something to prove on a vegan diet. Realistically on any diet big growth only happens after years of training so I don't expect much in the first 30 days. I do expect to lose weight though. 

Good luck Andy!
